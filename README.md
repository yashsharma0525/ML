# 🏠 Indian House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using **Linear Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm.  
The model is trained on housing-related features such as income, house age, number of rooms, and population.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on multiple numerical features.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

- Avg. Area Income  
- Avg. Area House Age  
- Avg. Area Number of Rooms  
- Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms  
- Area Population  

**Target Variable:**
- Price

> Note: The `Address` column was removed as it is non-numeric and not useful for Linear Regression.
